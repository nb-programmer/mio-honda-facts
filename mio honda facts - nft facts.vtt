00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.699
Time for some NFT facts!

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.099
NFTs are bad for the environment!

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.499
(Ouch!)

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.799
Ethereum mining produces more CO2 than entire countries!

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.199
(Bad!)

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.699
There are also problems with art theft!

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.099
(Oh no!)

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.399
Dead people's art has been sold as NFTs without permission!

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.799
(Illegal!)

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.799
NFTs are never OK!

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.199
There are much better ways to make money off your art!

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.899
Try doing commissions or OC adopts!

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.299
You don't actually own the image!

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.699
(You don't!)

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.999
You just own a hyperlink!

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.399
(That's it!)

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.799
Once the domain expires, anyone can buy it!

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.199
(Anyone!)

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.599
And redirect it to a shock site or even malware!

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.999
(Scary!)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.999
Using "Save image" is always OK!

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.399
There is no such thing as a "clean NFT"!

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.999
The NFT bubble has gotten so bad....

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.999
that the creator of NFTs, Anil Dash, has disowned them!
